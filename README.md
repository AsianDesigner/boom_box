# MF DOOM-esque Vinyl Player

This project is a site designed with html, css and javascript which will
act as a music player. The concept of design is an Anthony Fantano vibe,
having albums with records in the back with a centric vinyl player.
The idea is to drag records onto the player to activate the music.
Certain design aspects such as the color and texts are inspired by the
aesthetic of rapper MF DOOM.
