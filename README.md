# MF DOOM-esque Vinyl Player

This project is a site designed with html, css and javascript which will
act as a music player. The concept of design is an Anthony Fantano vibe,
having albums with records in the back with a centric vinyl player.
The idea is to drag records onto the player to activate the music.
Certain design aspects such as the color and texts are inspired by the
aesthetic of rapper MF DOOM.

The project will require some technical undertaking to have the player only
play music once records are dragged onto the player. The vinyl will also
spin when playing and stop when paused. An extra technical undertaking which I
haven't planned for yet, and could ultimately prove too ambitious, is slotting 
the records in and out the album sleeves and having them peek out when hovered on.
